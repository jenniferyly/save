          <h3>About</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Nessie is a mobile application that helps people find public restrooms
            and allows them to rate their cleanliness. Sometimes it's difficult to
            find a restroom when you're out and about whether it be actually in a
            obscure location or the closest restroom is in a business and requires
            a purchase to be used, Nessie is meant to take away some of the stress
            so you can find a restroom with ease. The app allows users to also rate
            the restroom's cleanliness and add tags, such as handicap stall availability,
            parking accessibility, key/pin required, and many more. Originally made by
            team members Iev Khov, Jennifer Ly, Jenna Zing, and Vivienne Zing for

            project.

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Food waste is a serious issue in the United States. People waste billions
            of pounds of food due to many reasons including but not limited to
            refusal to eat leftovers, not knowing what to cook with their produce,
            or not knowing how to store their food properly. From our research, we found
            that one of the biggest reasons for food waste is forgetting expiration dates.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coll">
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Our team decided to design an app that users can track expiration dates in
            while adding a fun element to give further incentive for users to more
            actively use it. By having a digital companion users can play with and care
            for, users will be more likely to check in on the app and be more aware of
            their food and expiration dates.

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          Our team surveyed 32 UC Davis students to find the cause of people wasting
          food and found the biggest reason is that people tend to forget the
          expiration dates and they do nothing to prevent it. From the survey,
          we found that 50% of people waste food because they forget the
          expiration dates and even 25% of people do nothing to avoid
          forgetting them. From these results, it can be said that the problem
          is that some people do not care about the expiration dates and they
          waste the expired food.

        <div class="coll">
          <h4>Map and Sortable Location Table</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            The app loads with a map with custom color coded Nessie restroom icons
            and pullable locations table. The table is defaultly sorted by closest
            distance but can also be sorted by ratings.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coll">
          <h4>Restroom Rating and Details</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            When selecting a restroom from the map or table, you will be able to get
            directions to said restroom along with more details such as the type of
            stall, drying options, etc.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coll">
          <h4>Setting Options</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Opening the settings screen allows users to pick their preferences for
            the restrooms they'd like to see and filters to results seen on the map
            and location table.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coll">
          <h4>Add Locations</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Since this app is mainly based on user feedback and there would be no
            possible way for our team of four to add every restroom ourselves, we
            have an option to add a new location if one is found.

        <h3>Additional/Future Concepts and Features</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          Some features that the team discussed for future incorporation.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
          <div class="coll">
            <h4>Comments/Reviews</h4>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
              While some people might be fine seeing an average star rating, others
              find written reviews more reliable in determining the actually quality
              of whatever they are viewing, and that could include restrooms as well.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="coll">
            <h4>More Settings/Filters</h4>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
              We originally brainstormed a few key filters to start with, but we're
              certain there are others to consider so we'd like to add more filters
              such as diaper change stations, mirrors, etc.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="coll">
            <h4>Adding Hydration Stations</h4>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
              The original idea of Nessie included finding water fountains and hydration
              stations but we wanted to focus on the restroom aspect first, but
              this is still a concept we would like to add into our app.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="coll">
            <h4>In App Navigation</h4>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
              Currently, our app is coded to take the location of the restroom and opening
              an external map application to give the user directions, but of course the ideal
              is to not have to leave the app.
