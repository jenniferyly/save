          <h3>About</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Expitrack is a mobile application concept to help people remember to use
             their food through the use of a pet like in-app companion. By tapping
             into the potential of humans' nuturing nature towards cute things, this
              app is made to motivate the user to actively track their food
              purchases to help their companion stay healthy and grow. Originally made by
              team members Shuhei Tsuriya, Alexandr Iakovlev, Jennifer Ly, and Tianyi Liu for
              UC Davis 2020 Winter Quarter ECS 164: Human Computer Interaction course
              project. <!--Adjusted concept designs made by Jennifer Ly for possible
              future application development practice.-->

          <h3>The Problem</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Food waste is a serious issue in the United States. People waste billions
            of pounds of food due to many reasons including but not limited to
            refusal to eat leftovers, not knowing what to cook with their produce,
            or not knowing how to store their food properly. From our research, we found
            that one of the biggest reasons for food waste is forgetting expiration dates.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coll">
          <h3>The Solution</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Our team decided to design an app that users can track expiration dates in
            while adding a fun element to give further incentive for users to more
            actively use it. By having a digital companion users can play with and care
            for, users will be more likely to check in on the app and be more aware of
            their food and expiration dates.

        <h3>User Research</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          Our team surveyed 32 UC Davis students to find the cause of people wasting
          food and found the biggest reason is that people tend to forget the
          expiration dates and they do nothing to prevent it. From the survey,
          we found that 50% of people waste food because they forget the
          expiration dates and even 25% of people do nothing to avoid
          forgetting them. From these results, it can be said that the problem
          is that some people do not care about the expiration dates and they
          waste the expired food.

        <h3>User Testing</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          <i>Note: while the full original high fidelity prototype has been overwritten
          and is not displayed, the user testing was conducted on said prototype
          </i>
          <br>
          <br>
          Our team conducted five user tests by giving the prototype to the users to
          navigate without help or instructions from the designers. This helped us
           pinpoint areas that needed improvement.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
            <p style="text-align:left; max-width:100%;">
              The majority of the users stated they did not understand how to use
              the app or the menu was unclear. Our team decided to add a tutorial
              for when the user first launches the app that can be brought back up
              again at anytime by clicking a question mark button that was also
              added to the home screen. We also added labels to the navigation menu
              items. Many users also reported that the graph on the statistics screen
              was hard to understand due to the lack of units. Lastly, users said
              the app was not fun to play. Part of the team decided to remedy this
              by adding a mini-game portion. I personally thought that there was
              miscommunication in the "marketing" of the app as it's not meant to
              be a gaming app or an app you actively play on, but rather an app meant to have a
              passive fun component.

        <div class="coll">
          <h4>Virtual Companion</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            A character that lives on the home screen of the app. They are there
            the show the status of your food wasting habits. The more food you throw away,
            the weaker and sickly it will look.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coll">
          <h4>Virtual Currency</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            You can gain coins from logging food into the app. These coins can be
            used to customize your character. This is system is meant to encourage
            users to remember to log the food they buy.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coll">
          <h4>Barcode Scanner</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            To make logging your food easier, the app contains a barcode scanner that
            uses the phone camera to detect the barcode and pull the necessary data
            associated with said barcode.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coll">
          <h4>Food List</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            The app stores all the food you've inputted in a list organized by expiration
            dates. There's also a visual cue for the expiration date, the sooner the expiration
            date, the more red the item will appear on the list.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="coll">
          <h4>Statistics</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            The app will keep track of your food usage habits based on whether food is thrown out
            or not. If you also inputted the price of your food item, it will also calculate your
            spending habits in regard to food.
          </p>

        <h3>Additional/Future Concepts and Features</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          Some features I'd like to incorporate if I decide to fully develop this app.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
          <div class="coll">
            <h4>Food Database</h4>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
              Ideally, the app will be connected to a database of various food products so
              it can auto fill the expiration date of items that don't have a set expiration date
              (ie. fresh produce) by searching for the average shelf life. Additionally, the database
              could contain suggested storage methods for different types of foods and the app can
              suggest such methods to increase shelf life.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="coll">
            <h4>Recipe Suggestions</h4>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
              If the user can't figure out what to do with their food item, the app can suggest recipes
              containing the main selected item. If possible, I'd like it to take into account other
              items on the list whenever possible and have the recipes with the most items on the list
              show up first.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="coll">
            <h4>Food Safety Information</h4>
            <p style="text-align:left;">
              A disclaimer should be included whenever the app suggests an average
              shelf life expiration date and link to a section in the app with information
              about when food should be thrown out even if it's not past its "expiration"
              date yet along with other important food safety information, such as which produce
              it is safe or not to just cut mold off of and be safe to still use the
              non-moldy part.
