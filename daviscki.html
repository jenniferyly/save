          <h3>About</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Circle K International (CKI) is a student led community service organization
            with clubs all over the world. This is the website made for the Circle
            K International campus club at the University of California, Davis.
            While the theme of the club and thus the theme of the website changes
            every year, the 2018-2019 template has persisted up through and including
            the current year's (2020) design.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            During my first term as the webmaster and creative director of the DavisCKI
            website, I was mainly concerned about picking up the slack my predecessor
            had left behind. Their 2016-2017 design (not shown) was fairly minimalistic
            and clean to look at, however, it lacked a lot the necessary working
            components that the website was meant to be there for. The website is
            a potential first impression for new and prospective members to understand
            what the organization does while also providing older, returning members
            of the club somewhere to quickly get new information and resources.
            My main concern was to make the homepage a quick peek at what's going
            on that most people would likely only ever need to see the home page
            but the extra bits of information are just as quickly accessible for
            those who want it.

          <h3>Context</h3>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Every year, clubs in Circle K International choose a theme for their club
            to design unique graphics and other fun elements around. The theme
            for the UCDavis club in the 2018-2019 term was Greek Mythology.

        <h3>2018 Initial Revamp</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          While I do not have the 2017-2018 website archived, I do have the initial
          revamp the website was undergoing for the 2018-2019 year. Added and retained
          from my 2017-2018 design, the Upcoming Events were visible on the homepage
          first thing after our welcome banner. The club's total hours were also
          added as something to keep returning members motivated and allow them to
          visibly see that the time they put into the club really do add up.

        <h3>2018-2019 Finalized Revamp</h3>
        <p style="text-align:left;">
          I had attempted to fix what I originally had on the website from my previous
          term's work, however, in the end I decided to start from scratch and look at
          existing wix templates for inspiration. After playing around with the templates,
          I was able to settle on this design. I still kept many of the elements
          previously seen but designed it in a more centered view with portions
          that extend to the edges of the screen to also break up the information
          into more digestible chunks.

          <h4>Map and Sortable Location Table</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            The app loads with a map with custom color coded Nessie restroom icons
            and pullable locations table. The table is defaultly sorted by closest
            distance but can also be sorted by ratings.

          <h4>Restroom Rating and Details</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            When selecting a restroom from the map or table, you will be able to get
            directions to said restroom along with more details such as the type of
            stall, drying options, etc.

          <h4>Setting Options</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Opening the settings screen allows users to pick their preferences for
            the restrooms they'd like to see and filters to results seen on the map
            and location table.

        <div class="coll">
          <h4>Add Locations</h4>
          <p style="text-align:left;">
            Since this app is mainly based on user feedback and there would be no
            possible way for our team of four to add every restroom ourselves, we
            have an option to add a new location if one is found.
